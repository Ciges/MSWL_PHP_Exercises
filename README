This is the PHP Code for the PHP session exercises for the Igalia and URJC's Master of Software Libre (http://www.mastersoftwarelibre.com/)

The exercises are two:
- In the first one a database with users and passwords is created and a form for introducing and validating user id ans passwords is developed
- The second one is coming soon :-)
